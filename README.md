# Code Refactoring: Goals, Benefits, and Why Itâ€™s Important

link to the article: https://langate.com/code-refactoring/

there is one paragraph which bring me great shock 

```
"Technical debt has existed for years and haunts every business owner in their nightmares. Now, it has become a serious issue that can greatly impact any company. For instance, poor software quality costs more than $150 billion per year in the United States and greater than $500 billion per year worldwide."
```

This paragraph emphasizes the economic incentive of incorporating code refactoring early on, by illustrating the savings in costs, efforts, and time that can be realized by avoiding the accrual of technical debt. This paragraph serves as a compelling argument for the business case of code refactoring, thereby making it a crucial part of the discussion.
